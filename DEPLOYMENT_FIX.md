# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Issue
The gh-pages branch was showing a blank page due to routing configuration problems.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Router Configuration
- Changed from `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` in `src/App.js`
- Removed `basename="/HiveSurf"` which was causing routing issues
- HashRouter works better with GitHub Pages as it doesn't require server-side routing

### 2. 404.html
- Updated `public/404.html` with proper SPA redirect script
- This handles direct URL access on GitHub Pages

### 3. Build Process
- Added clean and rebuild scripts to package.json
- Ensured proper build configuration

## Deployment Steps

1. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   npm run clean
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to gh-pages:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Wait for GitHub Pages to update** (usually 5-10 minutes)

## Why This Fixes the Blank Page

- **HashRouter**: Uses URL hash (#) for routing, which GitHub Pages can handle without server configuration
- **No basename**: Removes the `/HiveSurf` path requirement that was causing routing conflicts
- **Proper 404 handling**: Ensures direct URL access works correctly

## Testing

After deployment, test these URLs:
- `https://kaibalya113.github.io/HiveSurf/` (should redirect to home)
- `https://kaibalya113.github.io/HiveSurf/#/home`
- `https://kaibalya113.github.io/HiveSurf/#/about`
- `https://kaibalya113.github.io/HiveSurf/#/services`
- `https://kaibalya113.github.io/HiveSurf/#/contact`

## Note
URLs will now include `#` (hash) which is normal for HashRouter. This is the standard way to handle SPA routing on GitHub Pages.
